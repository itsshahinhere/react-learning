## This repo was created during my initial days of learning React js from [**Namaste React** course by Akshay saini](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-react).

Here i have created a simple Swiggy like web app with live swiggy api.


## The lessons learnt are:

 - React elements and React root
 - NPM packages and dependencies
 - Bundlers 
 - React components 
 - React hooks such as useState() and useEffect()

To use this repo:

 - fork the repo
 - open in VS Code
 - install the required packages using `npm install`
 - run the project using `npm start`
 - then open the provided local host
